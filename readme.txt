View changes made by the users of the system. It’s a history/change log/audit/recent changes-plugin.

== Description ==

Simple History is a plugin that shows recent changes made within WordPress.

Users of the system can see what articles have been created, modified or deleted,
and what attachments have been uploaded, modified or deleted? And so on. You get the idea.

It’s a pretty good plugin to have on websites where several people are 
involved: __”Has someone done anything today? Ah, Sarah uploaded 
the new press release and created an article for it. Good. Now I know.”__

It fits perfectly on your dashboard – or on a separate page. It's all configurable.
